#### Fully Remote

- Technically led and line managed a team of 5 engineers, ranging from junior to senior level, to maintain and develop new features on the Foundations flagship offerings [Code Editor](https://editor.raspberrypi.org) and [Projects Site](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/) as well as [Code Club World](https://codeclubworld.org/) and the initial development of [Experience AI](https://experience-ai.org).
- Responsibly for the technical implementation and successfully delivery of the integration of the Code Editor into the Projects Site for a more encompassing user learning experience e.g. [Target Practice](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/editor-target-practice/editor) aimed at teaching Python through the visual library P5.
- Maintained and developed new features utilising React and Ruby on Rails. Notably, I spearheaded the overhaul of the Projects Site homepage, implementing a modern and responsive design with improved navigation and discoverability.
- Introduced key user-led features into the Code Editor such as HTML/CSS functionality, furthering the types of projects users can create and our [Code Editor for Education](https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/education) to enable teachers and students to utilise the editors functionality in a safe and dedicated platform.
