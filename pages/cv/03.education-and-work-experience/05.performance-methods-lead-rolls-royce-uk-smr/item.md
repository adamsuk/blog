#### Rolls-Royce, Jubilee House, Derby // Engineering

- Lead, developed and maintenance the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) thermal hydraulic analysis method utilising Python and modern software techniques. This predominantly included defining the overarching programme methods framework, integration with other methods and expanding our code base with historic programmes for modelling specific parts of the plant.
- As a result of COVID-19 I implemented and distributed 7 development machines and maintained the server machine (utilising Ubuntu, Puppet, GitLab, Docker and MySQL) enabling a team to continue as normal through the first year of the pandemic.
- Authored two workstream strategies, one for Thermal Hydraulic analysis/methods and another for Modelling and Analytics (detailing the route to adopt cloud computing).
