#### Rolls-Royce, Jubilee House, Derby.

- Lead, developed and maintenance the Small Modular Reactor (SMR) thermal hydraulic analysis method. This predominantly included defining the overarching programme methods framework (of which the thermal hydraulic method was the most mature and leading the way), integration with other methods and expanding our code base (with soft and hard coupled techniques).
- As a result of COVID-19 I implemented and distributed 7 development machines and maintained the server machine (utilising Ubuntu, Puppet, GitLab, Docker and MySQL) enabling a team to continue as normal through the first year of the pandemic.
- Authored two workstream strategies, one for Thermal Hydraulic analysis/methods and another for Modelling and Analytics (detailing the route to cloud computing, from defining how to develop a discipline specific analysis method to integrating and coupling to other methods).
