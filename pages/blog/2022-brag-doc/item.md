After reading a [little article about celebrating successes](https://github.com/readme/guides/document-success) I wanted to give it a whirl, so before I forget what I've got for a quarter of 2022 I thought I'd get it started! My plan is to add to this as the year progresses.

### March

- Introduced [Grav to my personal site](https://github.com/adamsuk/sradams-co-uk-content/pull/63/files) to host blog content like this!
- Refactored my CloudFront Terraform into a reusable module. I've still got my skills ðŸ’ª
- Completed my very first Triathlon! 400m swim, 22km bike and 5km run at [East Leake Triathlon in 1hour 36mins](https://www.titaniumracetiming.co.uk/TRT/pages/event_rider_detail/189/167580).
- Started as an instructor at [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/classes/uni-kickstarter/) teach an "Introduction to Web Development".

### February

- Began my Ruby and Rails journey using [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/), the awesome [Rails docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and amazing support at RPF to put my learning into practice helping to develop a badging service for the [projects site pathways](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths).
- Got stuck into AWS for the first time writing terraform to provision all the required resource for a [CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for a Rails API.

### January

- Deployed an end-to-end working platform for loan originations. Utilised [Apollo Express GraphQL servers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) to orchestrate services calls with business logic in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and data obtained from 3rd party APIs. All hosted on [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) and accessible via NGINX. It worked and it was absolute boss and left Koodoo on a high.
- Refactored my [personal site](https://github.com/adamsuk/sradams-co-uk-content/pull/45/files) into a super-slick Next.js MACHINE!
- Started my new role as Senior Software Engineer at the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/meet-the-team/)!
- Deployed my first change to production on the Code Club World site - only a minor improvement to centralise a clicked activity popup but I got it in early!! ðŸ¥³
