After reading a [little article about celebrating successes](https://github.com/readme/guides/document-success) I wanted to give it a whirl, so before I forget what I've got for a quarter of 2022 I thought I'd get it started! My plan is to add to this as the year progresses.

### November

- Smashed my 5 min/km goal across a 10k with a time of 48:50 mins.
- Surfaced project search data in a Data Studio dashboard to inform future search improvements and potential content gaps ü§ì

### October

- Got the Software Engineering Manager role!! üòÆ
- Under 7s team won our first game.
- Implemented a BUNCH of [CodeClub World gallery](https://codeclubworld.org/gallery) improvements with the team, go check it out.

### September

- Finished teaching and marking my first cohort of future Fullstack engineers with CFG.
- Started managing my boys u7s football team on Sunday mornings.
- Smashed my 5 min/km goal across a 5k with a time of 23:30 mins.

### August

### July

- My Raspberry Pi position was confirmed permanent so I'll be sticking around the RPF ü•≥
- Tasked with and presented my approach to a complete overhaul of project site pathways (e.g. [Introduction to Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro)). Working with the designers with their slick designs in hand we broke it down into an MVP and chunked the work up to allow multiple devs to work on it. This included the use of a new design system approach and Storybook implementation for quick design feedback.
- Gave a team tech talk on Terraform basics, a nice little Terraform 101 session that was well received and blew away some IaC cobwebs with some code examples.

### June

- Ran my first ever half marathon at the [Nottingham Holme Run in 1hour 59minutes 7seconds](http://results.eventchiptiming.com/myresults.aspx?uid=16202-8300-3-185966) üí™
- Furthered my Postgres skills with new Google DataStudio dashboards and queries for business reporting using in-app data.
- Smashed some DevOps by adding some functionality to automatically add/remove GitHub Actions to project site content repositories to speed up S3 uploads. We've gone from 14min builds (almost hitting hard timeouts) to 3mins for our biggest projects due to the S3 uploads now being seconds! üòé

### May

- A data focused month at work saw my pick up and write my own complex PostgreSQL queries. I've maintained and partially wrote business analytics queries before but this was my first time solo and end-to-end! From changing the administrate dashboards for tagging content to writing a query to tag old content and cascade it through to new Google DataStudio dashboards.
- Started as a freelance instructor for [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) as one of the leads for the fullstack specialism!
- Wrote a nice little chunk of code I was proud of to compare two XML snippets for key differences, this was used in Code Club World to award badges for remixed Scratch projects.

### April

- Ruby badge service I helped develop was deployed on the Raspberry Pi Foundation projects site for the [new Scratch pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro) üòç
- Holidayed for the first time in 2 years with my family in Spain!!
- My first page from scratch for RPF went live on [Code Club World](https://codeclubworld.org/parents)

### March

- Introduced [Grav to my personal site](https://github.com/adamsuk/sradams-co-uk-content/pull/63/files) to host blog content like this!
- Refactored my CloudFront Terraform into a reusable module. I've still got my skills üí™
- Completed my very first Triathlon! 400m swim, 22km bike and 5km run at [East Leake Triathlon in 1hour 36mins](https://www.titaniumracetiming.co.uk/TRT/pages/event_rider_detail/189/167580).
- Started as an instructor at [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/classes/uni-kickstarter/) teach an "Introduction to Web Development".

### February

- Began my Ruby and Rails journey using [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/), the awesome [Rails docs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) and amazing support at RPF to put my learning into practice helping to develop a badging service for the [projects site pathways](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths).
- Got stuck into AWS for the first time writing terraform to provision all the required resources for a [CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for a Rails API.

### January

- Deployed an end-to-end working platform for loan originations. Utilised [Apollo Express GraphQL servers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) to orchestrate services calls with business logic in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and data obtained from 3rd party APIs. All hosted on [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) and accessible via NGINX. It worked and it was absolutely boss, leaving Koodoo on a high.
- Refactored my [personal site](https://github.com/adamsuk/sradams-co-uk-content/pull/45/files) into a super-slick Next.js MACHINE!
- Started my new role as Senior Software Engineer at the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/meet-the-team/)!
